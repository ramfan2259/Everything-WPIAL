	<h1> Leechburg (0-1) Takes On Summit Academy (0-1) For A Week 1 Showdown</h1>

<p>Week 0 did not do any favors for either of the teams squaring off at Veterans Memorial Field Friday, September 1st. Summit Academy is coming off a “tune up” game for their Week 0 opponent Shady Side Academy as they were defeated 55-0. </p>

<p>Leechburg however is coming off of a loss to one of the oldest rivalries in the WPIAL as they lost 18-16 to Apollo Ridge in their Week 0 game. </p>

<p>Leechburg’s strength going into this week’s game will be their defense. They kept Apollo Ridge to minimal points in the second half despite the fact Apollo controlled the ball most of the half.</p>

<p>Leechburg will have to execute the ‘little things” on Friday night as on their first possession of the game in Week 0 resulted in a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown giving Apollo Ridge a quick 6-0 lead. 
</p>

<p>As seen in their week 0 game against Apollo Ridge, Leechburg’s offensive line is what settled the score in their 18-16 loss. The line seemed fatigued the entire second half and were losing the “psychical matchup” every play. Leechburg’s quarterback Jayden Floyd was able to escape the pocket enough to give the Devils some second half points. </p>

<p>Going into this Friday’s game on September 1st, Leechburg will be the favored team.  Don’t expect Summit Academy to go down easy. If they can get through Leechburg’s offensive line and put together some offense, they will give Leechburg a run for their money. </p>

<p>I have Leechburg winning this one 45-14.</p>
